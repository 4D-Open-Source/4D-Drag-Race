# 4D Drag Race
 A show down of coding approaches to the sieve of Eratosthenes.

This repo stems from a discussion on the 4D Forum: https://discuss.4d.com/t/4d-drag-racing/18342

After watching an episode of [Dave's Garage](https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3h62rgewZM) I decided to try doing the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) using [4D](https:www.4d.com). A little discussionwith some of fellow devs and, well, here we are. 

You will need a copy of 4D v18R5 or newer to run all the methods. A couple are written using *classes* and won't return any results in lower version though at the moment the other methods run fine. There are drastic differences in the results when the code is compiled. 

If you would like to contribute a method to this just ping me. 

Many thanks to the contributors to date:
